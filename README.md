# marlin-lenny
erectorbot 864 firmware using marlin 1.1

This is a fork of the Marlin 1.1.8 code.
I am making the changes (as best I can find) from the much older Marlin code that shipped with the machine.
Lenny didn't do me many favors except this one, all the code.

I want to be running the lastest and greatest on the Erectorbot EB864 (8ft Y 6ft X 4 ft Z) 3dprinter.
